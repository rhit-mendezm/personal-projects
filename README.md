This repository contains projects I have created inside and outside of the classroom!

**RISC-V-assembler:** Developed in python in Winter of 2024-25, this directory contains a RISC-V assembler that assembles assembly code into machine code.
The assembler supports most instructions, recognizes registers by its formal and informal name, and supports translating a collection of pseudoinstructions.
The tests were written by the CSSE professors at Rose-Hulman. These programs were written for CSSE 232: Computer Architecture I.

**database-connectivity:** Developed in javascript and typescript in Spring of 2024, this directory contains my database project. I worked with two other partners to implement
the backend and frontend of this database in 4 weeks. The project is meant to mimic Fizz, an anonymous social media app for college students. The website is hosted from the local machine
using the nodeJS library, and the program supports posting, commenting, liking, and blocking. As a team, we modeled our database with an entity-relationship diagram prior to developing the
software.

**data-structures:** Developed in java in Winter of 2023-24, this directory contains several projects of my implementation of data structures. All the data structures
I have implemented in this directory are:
* Binary heap
* Binary search tree
* Graph
* Height-balanced tree
* String hashset

Inside this directory is also a sorting directory where I implemented binary heapsort, quicksort, and treesort. 

Most of the tests inside this directory were written by the CSSE professors at Rose-Hulman. In some of these projects, I worked with a partner; I give credit to any 
students and professors who helped me in the headers of each file. These programs were written for CSSE 230: Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis.
