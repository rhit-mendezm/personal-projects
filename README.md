This repository contains projects I have created inside and outside of the classroom!

**RISC-V-assembler:** Developed in python in Winter of 2024, this directory contains a RISC-V assembler that assembles assembly code into machine code.
The assembler supports most instructions, recognizes registers by its formal and informal name, and supports translating a collection of pseudoinstructions.
The tests were written by the CSSE professors at Rose-Hulman. These programs were written for CSSE 232: Computer Architecture I.

**data-structures:** Developed in java in Winter of 2023, this directory contains several projects of my implementation of data structures. All the data structures
I have implemented in this directory are:
* Binary heap
* Binary search tree
* Graph
* Height-balanced tree
* String hashset

Inside this directory is also a sorting directory where I implemented binary heapsort, quicksort, and treesort. 

Most of the tests inside this directory were written by the CSSE professors at Rose-Hulman. In some of these projects, I worked with a partner; I give credit to any 
students and professors who helped me in the headers of each file. These programs were written for CSSE 230: Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis.
