This repository contains projects I have created inside and outside of the classroom!

**RISC-V-assembler:** Developed in python in Winter of 2024, this directory contains a RISC-V assembler that assembles assembly code into machine code.
The assembler supports most instructions, recognizes registers by its formal and informal name, and supports translating a collection of pseudoinstructions.
The tests were written by the CSSE professors at Rose-Hulman.
